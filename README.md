# Market-Analysis

## Purpose
This script is designed to perform an analysis of economic indicators. It reads data from a TSV file, and creates a line graph to visualize the data. The purpose of this script is to provide a clear and concise visual representation of economic indicators over time, which can be useful for economic research and forecasting.

## Language
The script is written in R, a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

## Dependencies
The script uses the `tidyverse` package, a collection of R packages designed for data science. If the `tidyverse` package is not installed, the script will automatically install it.

## Usage
To use this script, you need to have a TSV file with two columns: "Years" and "Economic Indicators". Replace the `file_path` variable with the path to your TSV file. Also, replace `x_column_name` and `y_column_name` in the `ggplot` function with the actual column names you want to plot on the x and y axes, respectively.

## Output
The output of this script is a line graph with the title "Line Graph of Data". The x-axis and y-axis labels will correspond to the column names you specified.
